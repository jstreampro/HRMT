  encodeURIComponent(`We are writing to convey the deep sense of betrayal felt by us, Israeli and Jewish women around the world, due to your actions—or rather, your lack of action. Jewish women worldwide, feel betrayed by your disregard to the atrocities committed against Jewish women by Hamas, including sexual abuse, rape, amputation, burning alive, the abduction and murder of women, adolescents, and girls on October 7th.
  
The #Hamas_Raped_MeToo movement is demanding a public condemnation, appearing on your social media platforms and on a visible place on your website, of these horrific acts of gender-based violence by December 20th. Failure to do so will result in your organization being listed on the highly visible 'Wall of Shame' (www.hamasrapedmetoo.com). We urge your organization to speak up against these crimes to reaffirm the rights and safety of women. 
And the immediate release of the abductees who are in the hands of the terrorist and barbaric organization Hamas.
  
Your organization has no reason to exist if it remains silent in the face of these atrocities: the apparent rape of Shani Louk, as depicted in a Hamas video, where her naked body is callously thrown into a pickup truck as if she were mere prey; the video showing a young girl, being dragged by her hair into a car, with her crotch area stained with blood; the heart-wrenching cries of a mother being raped by terrorists one after another, while her baby is tragically baked in an oven. And these are just a few among the growing number of horrific testimonies being revealed as the days pass. These were not random acts of violence, but rather actions carried out as per specific written instructions from the terrorist leaders.
  
The eyewitness reports we’ve seen are too hard to read. One report describes a woman is repeatedly raped by one terrorist after another. Then, the last one mutilates her by chopping her breasts off before murdering her!!
  
Our movement, #Hamas_Raped_MeToo, is supported by a growing number of influential figures globally. We will not stand by and let you get away with your silence, nor will we tolerate the growing monstrous voices of denial surrounding the heinous acts perpetrated on women and children and even men on October 7th. I urge you to be brave to summon the courage to speak up or resign from your agenda if you don’t. 
  
We are featuring your organization's logo in black & white on our movement's 'Wall of Shame’. The visibility of this display is increasing daily among a growing audience. If you wake up and issue a bold public statement of condemnation on your digital platforms, we will turn your logo from black to pink on our site, symbolizing a steadfast commitment to this cause. 
  
On December 21st, we intend to publicly showcase this list, shaming those who do not reaffirm every woman's right to bodily autonomy and safety. We will not let you continue deceiving women worldwide into believing you care about them. We will take whatever action necessary to hold you and your organization accountable.
  
Break this disgraceful silence at once and undo the shame you have brought upon yourselves. Please send us your public statement of commitment or condemnation as soon as possible, and no later than December 20th. 
  
No woman can stay silent! If you don't speak up, it's as if you allow Hamas to rape MeToo!
  
Hamas Raped MeToo movement.
  
Send us your condemnation to:
