We condemn these grave crimes against humanity and call for an international outrage against the perpetrators as well as collaborative efforts to bring them to justice. Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and the entire Israeli community for the horrific trauma and loss of lives. In light of the recently commemorated International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we call on all feminist organizations and international bodies to join the condemnation of the gender-based violence perpetrated by Hamas and demand for justice to be given to the victims.",

It does not matter when, where, or how sexual violence occurs, nor the identity of the victims or rapists. Regardless of nationality, race, religion, gender, motive, belief or any other factor, it is simply, and always, wrong. RAINN will always stand with survivors and victims of rape, and demand justice for those who have harmed them."

We unequivocally condemn these and other atrocities employed and sanctioned as part of the Hamas terror strategy. We have provided tip sheets to journalists on covering sexualized violence and sensitively interviewing survivors. We agree wholeheartedly with the international tribunals that codified the crime of sexualized violence as a crime against humanity and a war crime. We urge those at the United Nations and in the U.S. government to acknowledge all war crimes against women and we pledge to support survivors and to campaign for justice for those who have perpetrated these crimes."
